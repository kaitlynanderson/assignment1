      <p>My experience in web development includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CS0007</li>
        <li>I had a Tumblr (blog-like account) when I was in Middle School, and I remember going into the code at one point and inserting a line that would allow for continuous scrolling (does that count???)</li>
        <li>No other real experience, but I'm a college student so I'm on the web a bunch, and know what looks good asthetically. Exicited to learn how those websites come to be!</li>
